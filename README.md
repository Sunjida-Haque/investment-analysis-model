# 💼 Investment Analysis Model – Capital Budgeting & Profitability Forecast

This project was developed for an advanced finance course focused on **investment evaluation and financial modeling**. It simulates a real-life consulting scenario where a soft drink company is considering building a new production plant. The goal was to build a **dynamic investment analysis tool** that company managers can reuse for future project valuation.

## 🎯 Objective

To create a robust Excel-based tool that:
- Analyzes profitability of a large-scale investment using NPV, IRR, PI, and DPP
- Performs **sensitivity, scenario, and break-even analysis**
- Runs **Monte Carlo simulations** for risk forecasting
- Includes user-friendly automation through **VBA macros** and dashboard features

## 🧠 Key Features of the Model

- 💰 **Cash Flow Modeling**: Constructed accurate free cash flow models using nominal terms, excluding non-cash items like depreciation
- 📉 **Profitability Indicators**: Automated calculations of NPV, IRR, Profitability Index, and Discounted Payback Period
- 📊 **Dynamic Charts**: Graphs for visualizing cash flows, breakeven points, and probability distributions
- 🔁 **Break-Even Analysis**: Macro-enabled model testing three critical variables to determine when NPV = 0
- 📈 **Sensitivity Analysis**: Evaluated effects of 5 variables on key metrics using macro-enhanced simulations
- 🌐 **Scenario Analysis Tool**: Enabled forecasting across changing economic factors (tax, inflation, market conditions)
- 🎲 **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Simulated thousands of runs with uncertainty in 5 variables to estimate investment risk and opportunity
